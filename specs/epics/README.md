# Epics

Orun-style work programs. Each epic is a folder carrying `epic.yaml` (the
declaration the platform reads: slug, key prefix, milestones with exit
criteria and task keys) beside its doc set. The pull request that adds the
folder is the adoption; the merge creates the epic in the workspace.

| Epic | Cluster | Status | What it is |
|------|---------|--------|------------|
| [`nuxt-boilerplate/`](./nuxt-boilerplate/) | **NB** | 🟡 NB3 in progress | Vercel's Nuxt boilerplate, equivalent in code and function, running on Cloudflare Workers + Static Assets — and an Orun baseline that instantiates it (NB3) |

As-built ≠ intent: what shipped lives in each epic's `IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md`.
